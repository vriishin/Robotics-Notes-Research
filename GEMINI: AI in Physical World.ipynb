    "# Gemini Robotics: Bringing AI into the Physical World\n",
    "### Authors: Gemini Robotics team, Year: 25 Mar [2025], Institution: Google DeepMind\n",

    "### 1. Problem Context & Motivation\n",
    "- There is difficulty translating the capabilities of large multimodal models from digital tasks to the physical world via robots. E.g. there are models that are able to identify objects, but getting a robot to move a soup can over a pan right next to it might be difficult.\n",
    "- Particularly relevant now because physical agents (robots) are desirable for generalist tasks, which requires to them needing to have a data-heavy backbone (e.g gemini 2 VLM)\n",
    "- Previous work in VLM's (Vision language models) were able to accurately interpret images but can't generate robot actions or properly work in a 3d space. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Prior Work and State-of-the-Art\n",
    "- Key work and SoTA is the pi0 generalist policy\n",
    "- π₀ combines a pre-trained vision-language model (the backbone that gives reasoning) + flow‑matching for continuous control (i.e. making trajectories smooth) + training from different robot types + a two-stage training recipe (pretraining on general work -> fine tuning on task). \n",
    "- Brought zero-shot generalization (can handle new tasks without retraining), high-frequency smooth dexterity (robot moves fluidly/naturally with instructions at 50 Hz), and cross‑robot adaptability (form of robot doesnt matter.)\n",

    "- Include metaphors or analogies in a separate line if helpful\n",
    "- paper introduces reasoning benchmark Embodied Reasoning Question Answering (ERQA) and 2 models both with Gemini 2.0 as VLM backbone. \n",
    "    - Gemini 2.0 model  excels at tasks like detecting objects and points in 2D, leveraging 2D pointing for grasping and trajectories, and corresponding points and detecting objects in 3D. \n",
